/// Review Fraud Score Model
/// 
/// Represents a fraud risk assessment for a review/feedback submission.
/// Used to detect fake or fraudulent reviews.
/// 
/// **Philosophy Alignment:**
/// - Opens doors to authentic feedback
/// - Enables review quality control
/// - Supports platform trust
/// 
/// **Usage:**
/// ```dart
/// final reviewFraudScore = ReviewFraudScore(
///   id: 'review-fraud-123',
///   feedbackId: 'feedback-456',
///   riskScore: 0.75,
///   signals: [FraudSignal.allFiveStar, FraudSignal.sameDayClustering],
///   recommendation: FraudRecommendation.review,
/// );
/// ```
