/// SPOTS LocalLlmMacOSAutoInstallService Tests
/// Date: January 2025
/// Purpose: Test macOS-specific auto-install service for local LLM models
///
/// Test Coverage:
/// - Immediate download (no Wi-Fi/charging/idle gates)
/// - System compatibility detection
/// - Model tier selection based on capabilities
/// - Progress reporting
/// - Error handling and fallback
///
/// Dependencies:
/// - Mock LocalLlmModelPackManager
/// - Mock DeviceCapabilityService
/// - Mock OnDeviceAiCapabilityGate
/// - Mock LocalLlmProvisioningStateService
