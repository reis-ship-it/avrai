/// SPOTS AppRouter Unit Tests
/// Date: December 23, 2025
/// Purpose: Test AppRouter route configuration for Phase 9 Section 3
///
/// Test Coverage:
/// - Route Configuration: Router builds correctly
/// - New Routes: Federated learning, device discovery, AI2AI, actions routes exist
/// - Route Paths: Route paths are correctly configured
///
/// Dependencies:
/// - AppRouter: Router configuration
/// - AuthBloc: Authentication state management

      // - /discovery-settings (Phase 1)
      // - /federated-learning (Phase 2.1)
