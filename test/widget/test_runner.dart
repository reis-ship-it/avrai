/// Comprehensive Widget Test Suite Runner
/// 
/// This file orchestrates the execution of all Phase 8 widget tests,
/// ensuring comprehensive UI testing coverage for the SPOTS application.
/// 
/// Test Categories Covered:
/// - Authentication flows (login/signup)
/// - Onboarding wizard and homebase selection
/// - Map functionality and interaction
/// - List management interfaces
/// - Role-based UI adaptations
/// - Critical UI components (dialogs, permissions)
/// - Visual regression protection (golden tests)
/// 
/// Usage:
/// ```bash
/// flutter test test/widget/test_runner.dart
/// ```
/// 
/// For coverage analysis:
/// ```bash
/// flutter test --coverage test/widget/test_runner.dart
/// ```
