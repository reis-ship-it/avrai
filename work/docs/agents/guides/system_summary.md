# Agent System Summary - Complete Guide

**Date:** November 22, 2025, 8:40 PM CST  
**Purpose:** Complete overview of the parallel agent system  
**Status:** 🚀 Ready to Use

## 🎯 **What Changed**

### **1. Time Structure: Phases & Sections**
- **Old:** Weeks/Days/Months
- **New:** Phases/Sections
- **Why:** Easier for agents to follow, less time pressure, clearer structure

### **2. Dependency Checking System**
- **New File:** `docs/agents/status/status_tracker.md` - Real-time status tracking
- **New File:** `docs/agents/status/dependency_guide.md` - How to check dependencies
- **How It Works:** Agents check status tracker before starting tasks

### **3. Communication Protocol**
- **Status Tracker:** Agents update when completing work others depend on
- **Dependency Map:** Shows what depends on what
- **Blocked Tasks:** Shows who's waiting for what

---

## 📋 **How Dependency Checking Works**

### **Example: Agent 2 Needs Payment Models**

**Step 1: Agent 2 Checks Status Tracker**
```
Read: docs/agents/status/status_tracker.md

Check "Dependency Map":
- Agent 1 → Agent 2: Payment Models
- Status: ⏳ Waiting

Check "Completed Work":
- Agent 1 Completed Sections:
  - Section 1 ✅
  - Section 2 ❌ (not listed = not ready)
```

**Step 2: Agent 2 Decision**
- If Section 2 NOT in "Completed Work" → Blocked, wait
- If Section 2 IS in "Completed Work" → Ready, proceed

**Step 3: Agent 1 Completes Section 2**
```
Agent 1 updates status tracker:
- Moves Section 2 to "Completed Work"
- Updates "Dependency Map" to ✅ READY
- Removes Agent 2 from "Blocked Tasks"
```

**Step 4: Agent 2 Sees Update**
```
Agent 2 checks status tracker:
- Sees Section 2 in "Completed Work"
- Removes self from "Blocked Tasks"
- Proceeds with Payment UI
```

## 🔄 **How Agents Communicate**

### **Agent 1 Completes Payment Models:**

1. **Completes Section 2** (Payment Models)
2. **Updates Status Tracker:**
   ```
   Agent 1 Completed Sections:
   - Section 2 - Payment Models ✅ COMPLETE
   
   Dependency Map:
   - Agent 1 → Agent 2: Payment Models ✅ READY
   
   Blocked Tasks:
   - Remove "Agent 2: Payment UI" (dependency ready)
   ```
3. **Agent 2 sees update** and proceeds

### **Agent 2 Checks for Payment Models:**

1. **Before starting Payment UI:**
   - Reads `docs/agents/status/status_tracker.md`
   - Checks "Completed Work" section
   - Sees if Section 2 is listed

2. **If NOT listed:**
   - Adds self to "Blocked Tasks"
   - Continues with Event Discovery UI
   - Checks status tracker regularly

3. **If listed:**
   - Removes from "Blocked Tasks"
   - Proceeds with Payment UI
