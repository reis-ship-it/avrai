## 📝 Notes

1. **Dependency Injection**: All services registered in `lib/injection_container.dart`
2. **Circular Dependencies**: Avoided through dependency injection
3. **Service Ownership**: See `docs/agents/protocols/file_ownership.md` for detailed ownership
4. **Shared Services**: Coordinate changes to shared services
5. **High-Dependency Services**: `StorageService` and `ExpertiseService` are used by many services - changes require careful coordination
