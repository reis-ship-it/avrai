## 🚀 Session Start Checklist

> **⚠️ IMPORTANT: Review this section at the start of EVERY new chat/task**

### Quick Start Protocol

**When you receive a new task, ALWAYS do these steps IN ORDER:**

#### Step 0: Determine Task Type ✅

**Is this an implementation task or status query?**

#### Implementation Task:
User says: "implement", "create", "build", "add", "start", "proceed with"
→ Follow Steps 1-7 below

#### Status/Progress Query:
User says: "where are we with...", "what's the status of...", "how far along..."
→ **Use Comprehensive Document Search Protocol:**

```bash
# For status queries, find and read ALL related documents
Topic="[user's topic]"

# Find everything
glob_file_search("**/*${Topic}*.md")
glob_file_search("**/*${Topic}*complete*.md")
glob_file_search("**/*${Topic}*progress*.md")
glob_file_search("**/*${Topic}*status*.md")

# Search content
grep("${Topic}", path: "docs/", output_mode: "files_with_matches")

# Read ALL found documents (not just one!)
# Then synthesize comprehensive answer

# ❌ WRONG: Read only plan document
# ✅ RIGHT: Read plan + completion + progress + status docs
```

**See detailed protocol in:** `docs/START_HERE_NEW_TASK.md` → "Status/Progress Queries" section

---

### Step 1: Reference This Methodology ✅
```
✅ I have read/reviewed the DEVELOPMENT_METHODOLOGY.md
✅ I understand the systematic approach
✅ I will follow the quality standards
```

#### Step 2: Understand the Task (5 minutes)
- [ ] Read the user's request completely
- [ ] Identify the primary goal
- [ ] Note any specific requirements
- [ ] Check if this relates to an existing plan

**Example Questions:**
- What exactly needs to be built?
- Is this a new feature or enhancement?
- Are there specific constraints?
- What's the expected outcome?

#### Step 3: Cross-Reference Plans & Context (10 minutes) 🔍
**CRITICAL: Always check these sources BEFORE starting:**

1. **Main Feature Plan**
   ```bash
   read_file('docs/FEATURE_MATRIX_COMPLETION_PLAN.md')
   # Is this task part of a larger plan?
   # What's the context within the overall roadmap?
   ```

2. **Related Plans**
   ```bash
   glob_file_search('**/*PLAN*.md')
   glob_file_search('**/*STRATEGY*.md')
   # Are there other plans that mention this feature?
   # What dependencies exist?
   ```

3. **Completion Documents**
   ```bash
   glob_file_search('**/*COMPLETE*.md')
   # Has similar work been done?
   # What patterns were established?
   # What lessons were learned?
   ```

4. **Implementation Progress**
   ```bash
   glob_file_search('**/*PROGRESS*.md')
   # Where are we in the overall plan?
   # What's already in progress?
   ```

5. **Coherence Gate Contract (for cross-system scope)**
   ```bash
   read_file('docs/plans/architecture/REALITY_COHERENCE_TEST_MATRIX.md')
   # Which RCM scenario IDs apply?
   # What evidence/no-go gates apply?
   ```

**See detailed instructions in: [Cross-Referencing & Context Gathering](#cross-referencing--context-gathering)**

#### Step 4: Search for Existing Work (5 minutes)
- [ ] Search for related files/components
- [ ] Check if similar features exist
- [ ] Look for reusable patterns
- [ ] Identify what can be leveraged

```bash
# Search by feature name
glob_file_search('**/*feature_name*.dart')

# Search by concept
grep('class.*FeatureName')
codebase_search('How does similar feature work?')
```

#### Step 5: Assess Optimal Placement (5 minutes)
**Where does this fit in the system?**

- [ ] Which layer? (UI, Service, Repository, Model)
- [ ] Which module? (core, presentation, data)
- [ ] **Which package?** (spots_core, spots_network, spots_ml, spots_ai, spots_quantum, spots_knot, spots_app)
- [ ] **Package boundaries?** (What belongs in this package vs others?)
- [ ] **Dependencies?** (What other packages does this need?)
- [ ] **Public API?** (What will other packages use?)
- [ ] Integration points? (What does it connect to?)

**Package Placement Decision Framework:**
- **Core models/data structures** → `spots_core`
- **Network/API communication** → `spots_network`
- **ML models/inference** → `spots_ml`
- **AI2AI learning/personality** → `spots_ai`
- **Quantum services/matching** → `spots_quantum`
- **Knot theory services** → `spots_knot`
- **UI/Application logic** → `spots_app`

**See detailed guide in: [Optimal Placement Strategy](#optimal-placement-strategy)**

#### Step 6: Create Implementation Plan (10 minutes)
- [ ] Create TODO list
- [ ] Identify dependencies
- [ ] Estimate realistic timeline
- [ ] Note potential risks

```dart
todo_write(
  merge: false,
  todos: [
    {"id": "1", "status": "in_progress", "content": "Context gathering"},
    {"id": "2", "status": "pending", "content": "Component A"},
    // ... detailed tasks
  ]
)
```

#### Step 7: Communicate Plan (2 minutes)
- [ ] Summarize what you found
- [ ] Explain your approach
- [ ] Note any existing work discovered
- [ ] Set expectations for timeline

**Example Communication:**
```
📋 Task Analysis Complete

Found:
- Related plan: FEATURE_MATRIX_COMPLETION_PLAN.md (Phase 2.3)
- Existing: 3/4 components already implemented
- Missing: Integration + Documentation
- Optimal placement: Settings page, new tab

Approach:
1. Leverage existing components
2. Create integration page
3. Add navigation
4. Document completion

Estimated: 2-3 hours (vs 5 days in original plan)
Ready to proceed?
```

## Philosophy & Principles

### Core Philosophy

**"Complete, don't just implement."**

Implementation is not done when code compiles. It's done when:
- ✅ Code works and is tested
- ✅ Code is integrated into the app
- ✅ Code is documented
- ✅ Users can access the feature
- ✅ No blockers remain

### Guiding Principles

1. **Systematic Progression**: Break large tasks into manageable pieces
2. **Quality Over Speed**: Zero errors is better than fast delivery
3. **Documentation is Code**: If it's not documented, it doesn't exist
4. **Integration is Key**: Isolated components aren't features
5. **Completeness Matters**: Finish what you start
6. **Context is Critical**: Understand before building
7. **Communication is Constant**: Keep everyone informed

---

## Cross-Referencing & Context Gathering

> **This is the most important step. Poor context = wasted effort.**

### Why Cross-Referencing Matters

**Real-world impact from SPOTS project:**
- Phase 1 Integration: Discovered existing widgets → Saved 5 days
- Phase 2.1: Found 4 complete widgets → Saved 11 days
- Phase 2.2/2.3: Found already complete → Saved 2+ weeks

**Without cross-referencing:** Build duplicate code, miss dependencies, poor integration  
**With cross-referencing:** Leverage existing work, optimal placement, seamless integration

---

### Step-by-Step Cross-Referencing Guide

#### 1. Find ALL Plans (Comprehensive Discovery)

**Cast a wide net first, then filter intelligently.**

```bash
# Find EVERYTHING with "plan" in the name
glob_file_search('**/*plan*.md')
glob_file_search('**/*PLAN*.md')

# Also check for related planning documents
glob_file_search('**/*roadmap*.md')
glob_file_search('**/*strategy*.md')
glob_file_search('**/*transition*.md')
glob_file_search('**/*implementation*.md')
```

**Smart Filtering Strategy:**

After finding all plans, assess each one using these criteria:

##### A. Recency Check (How old is this plan?)

```bash
# Check file modification dates
run_terminal_cmd('ls -lht docs/*plan*.md')

# Categorize by age
Recent (<7 days)    → HIGH PRIORITY - Likely current work
Moderate (7-30 days) → MEDIUM - May still be relevant
Old (30-90 days)     → LOW - Verify still active
Very Old (>90 days)  → HISTORICAL - Context only
```

**Decision Matrix:**
```
Task relates to topic + Recent plan     → READ THOROUGHLY
Task relates to topic + Old plan        → SKIM for context
Task unrelated + Recent plan            → SKIM for conflicts
Task unrelated + Old plan               → SKIP (unless referenced)
```

##### B. Relevance Check (Does this relate to current task?)

**Method 1: Filename Analysis**
```bash
Task: "Implement federated learning"

Plans found:
✅ federated_learning_plan.md           → HIGH RELEVANCE (exact match)
✅ FEATURE_MATRIX_COMPLETION_PLAN.md    → HIGH RELEVANCE (likely contains section)
⚠️ phase_4_implementation_plan.md       → MEDIUM RELEVANCE (might mention it)
❌ authentication_strategy.md            → LOW RELEVANCE (different domain)
```

**Method 2: Content Search**
```bash
# Search plan contents for task keywords
grep('federated learning', path: 'docs/*plan*.md')
grep('learning round', path: 'docs/')
grep('privacy metrics', path: 'docs/')

# This reveals which plans actually discuss the topic
```

##### C. Plan Priority/Status Check

**Read the plan to determine:**
```markdown
Plan Status Indicators:
✅ ACTIVE - Currently being executed
⏳ IN PROGRESS - Partially complete
📋 PLANNED - Future work
✅ COMPLETE - Done (historical reference)
❌ DEPRECATED - No longer valid
⚠️ ON HOLD - Paused/blocked
```

**Priority Indicators:**
```markdown
Critical Path Plans:
- FEATURE_MATRIX_* (master plan)
- *_COMPLETION_PLAN (active phases)
- *_TRANSITION_PLAN (current changes)

Supporting Plans:
- *_STRATEGY (approach documents)
- *_IMPLEMENTATION (detailed specs)
- *_PROGRESS (status updates)

Historical Plans:
- *_ARCHIVE (old versions)
- *_LEGACY (superseded)
```

##### D. Plan Hierarchy Assessment

**Understand the relationship between plans:**

```
Master Plans (Top Level)
├─ FEATURE_MATRIX_COMPLETION_PLAN.md
│  ├─ Phase 1 Plan (if exists)
│  ├─ Phase 2 Plan (if exists)
│  └─ Phase 3 Plan (if exists)
│
├─ ROADMAP.md (if exists)
└─ PROJECT_PLAN.md (if exists)

Feature-Specific Plans (Mid Level)
├─ federated_learning_plan.md
├─ ai2ai_implementation_plan.md
└─ device_discovery_plan.md

Tactical Plans (Low Level)
├─ phase_4_implementation_strategy.md
├─ test_suite_update_plan.md
└─ compilation_fixes_plan.md
```

**Reading Strategy:**
1. Start with master plans (get overall picture)
2. Drill down to feature-specific plans (get details)
3. Check tactical plans (get implementation specifics)

##### E. Conflict Detection

**While reading plans, watch for:**

```markdown
Red Flags (Potential Conflicts):
⚠️ Same feature in multiple plans with different specs
⚠️ Overlapping timelines/dependencies
⚠️ Contradictory requirements
⚠️ Different priority assignments
⚠️ Architectural mismatches

Examples:
Plan A: "Add to Settings page"
Plan B: "Add to Profile page"
→ CONFLICT! Needs resolution before coding.

Plan A: "Phase 2.1 - Complete by Week 4"
Plan B: "Phase 2.1 requires Phase 1.4 (Week 5)"
→ CONFLICT! Dependency timeline issue.
```

### Intelligent Plan Reading Order

**Don't read all plans - read smart:**

```
1. Master Plan (Always read)
   └─ FEATURE_MATRIX_COMPLETION_PLAN.md
      → Get overall context

2. Recent + High Relevance (Read thoroughly)
   └─ Plans modified <30 days with task keywords
      → Get current context

3. Old + High Relevance (Skim for context)
   └─ Plans modified >30 days with task keywords
      → Get historical context

4. Recent + Medium Relevance (Quick scan)
   └─ Plans modified <7 days in related areas
      → Check for conflicts

5. Everything Else (Skip unless needed)
   └─ Old plans, unrelated topics
      → Reference only if questions arise
```

**Time Budget:**
- Master plan: 5 minutes (always)
- High relevance plans: 3 minutes each
- Medium relevance: 1 minute each
- Low relevance: Skip

**Total: 10-15 minutes for comprehensive coverage**

---

### Advanced Search Techniques

**Finding Related Plans by Topic:**

```bash
# Task: Implement federated learning UI

# Step 1: Direct keyword search
grep('federated learning', path: 'docs/', output_mode: 'files_with_matches')

# Step 2: Related concept search
grep('privacy.*learning', path: 'docs/')
grep('distributed.*training', path: 'docs/')
grep('model.*aggregation', path: 'docs/')

# Step 3: Semantic search (if task is complex)
codebase_search('What plans discuss federated learning?', target_directories: ['docs/'])

# Step 4: Check for phase/section mentions
grep('Phase 2\.1', path: 'docs/')
grep('Section 2\.1', path: 'docs/')
```

**Finding Plans by Recency:**

```bash
# List all plans by modification date
run_terminal_cmd('ls -lht docs/*plan*.md | head -20')
run_terminal_cmd('ls -lht docs/*PLAN*.md | head -20')

# Find recently modified plans (last 7 days)
run_terminal_cmd('find docs -name "*plan*.md" -mtime -7')

# Find plans modified in specific timeframe
run_terminal_cmd('find docs -name "*plan*.md" -mtime -30 -mtime +7')
```

---

### Example: Complete Plan Discovery & Analysis

**Task:** "Implement federated learning UI"

#### Step 1: Discover All Plans
```bash
$ glob_file_search('**/*plan*.md')

Found 12 plans:
1. FEATURE_MATRIX_COMPLETION_PLAN.md (800 lines, 30 days old)
2. PHASE_4_TO_FEATURE_MATRIX_TRANSITION_PLAN.md (400 lines, 45 days old)
3. federated_learning_detailed_plan.md (200 lines, 60 days old)
4. phase_4_implementation_strategy.md (150 lines, 5 days old)
5. test_suite_update_plan.md (300 lines, 10 days old)
6. authentication_implementation_plan.md (100 lines, 90 days old)
7. database_migration_plan.md (200 lines, 120 days old)
... (5 more)
```

#### Step 2: Quick Relevance Filter
```bash
$ grep('federated learning', path: 'docs/', output_mode: 'files_with_matches')

Matches in:
- FEATURE_MATRIX_COMPLETION_PLAN.md (HIGH RELEVANCE)
- PHASE_4_TO_FEATURE_MATRIX_TRANSITION_PLAN.md (MEDIUM RELEVANCE)
- federated_learning_detailed_plan.md (HIGH RELEVANCE)
- privacy_strategy.md (MEDIUM RELEVANCE)

$ grep('Phase 2\.1', path: 'docs/')

Matches in:
- FEATURE_MATRIX_COMPLETION_PLAN.md (HIGH RELEVANCE)
```

#### Step 3: Recency + Relevance Matrix

| Plan | Age | Relevance | Priority |
|------|-----|-----------|----------|
| FEATURE_MATRIX_COMPLETION_PLAN.md | 30d | HIGH | **READ NOW** |
| federated_learning_detailed_plan.md | 60d | HIGH | **SKIM** |
| PHASE_4_TRANSITION_PLAN.md | 45d | MEDIUM | **SKIM** |
| phase_4_implementation_strategy.md | 5d | LOW | **SKIP** |
| authentication_plan.md | 90d | NONE | **SKIP** |

#### Step 4: Read in Priority Order

**1. FEATURE_MATRIX_COMPLETION_PLAN.md (5 min)**
```markdown
Found: Phase 2.1 - Federated Learning UI
- 4 widgets needed
- 11 days estimated
- Dependencies: None
- Status: Backend ✅, UI ❌
- Location: Settings page

→ This is the PRIMARY source
```

**2. federated_learning_detailed_plan.md (3 min)**
```markdown
Found: Backend implementation details (already complete)
- Data models: FederatedLearningRound, PrivacyMetrics
- Services: FederatedLearningSystem
- Status: ✅ Complete (60 days ago)

→ Backend is done, this is REFERENCE only
```

**3. PHASE_4_TRANSITION_PLAN.md (2 min)**
```markdown
Mentions: Federated learning moved from Phase 4 to Phase 2
- Reason: Priority increase
- Timeline: Adjusted

→ HISTORICAL CONTEXT, explains why Phase 2
```

#### Step 5: Analysis Summary

**Key Findings:**
- Main plan is FEATURE_MATRIX (30 days old, current)
- Task is Phase 2.1, needs 4 UI widgets
- Backend complete (from 60-day-old plan)
- Originally Phase 4, moved to Phase 2 (priority)
- No conflicts detected

**Implementation Strategy:**
1. Check if widgets already exist
2. Build/integrate missing pieces
3. Follow Phase 2.1 specifications
4. Reference backend from old plan for data structures

**Time Estimate:**
- Plan analysis: 10 minutes
- Implementation: TBD based on existing work

→ Ready to proceed with context

#### 2. Check for Related Plans

**Features often span multiple plans. Check all related documents.**

```bash
# Find all planning documents
glob_file_search('**/*PLAN*.md')
glob_file_search('**/*STRATEGY*.md')

# Search for mentions of the feature
grep('federated learning', path: 'docs/')
grep('feature_name')
```

**What to look for:**
- Is this mentioned in multiple plans?
- Are there conflicting requirements?
- What's the priority across plans?
- Are there timeline dependencies?

**Cross-Plan Considerations:**
```
Plan A: Says "Add feature to Settings"
Plan B: Says "Add feature to Profile"
Plan C: Says "Create dedicated page"

→ Conflict! Need to clarify optimal placement.
→ Check most recent plan or ask user.
```

#### 3. Review Completion Documents

**Check what's already been completed in related areas.**

```bash
# Find completion documents
glob_file_search('**/*COMPLETE*.md')
glob_file_search('**/*SECTION*COMPLETE*.md')

# Read recent completions
read_file('docs/FEATURE_MATRIX_SECTION_2_2_COMPLETE.md')
```

**What to extract:**
- Patterns established (UI patterns, architecture)
- Technologies used (packages, services)
- Known issues or limitations
- What worked well
- What to avoid

**Example Extraction:**
```
From SECTION_2_2_COMPLETE.md:
- Used AIImprovementTrackingService pattern
- Widgets in lib/presentation/widgets/settings/
- Tests in test/widget/widgets/settings/
- Integration via Settings page tabs
- Doc template: Executive Summary → Features → Metrics → Next Steps

→ Follow the same pattern for consistency!
```

#### 4. Check Implementation Progress

**See where the project currently stands.**

```bash
# Find progress documents
glob_file_search('**/*PROGRESS*.md')
glob_file_search('**/*STATUS*.md')

# Check recent progress
read_file('docs/PHASE_1_2_PROGRESS_SUMMARY.md')
```

**What to look for:**
- What's currently being worked on?
- What's blocked?
- What's the next priority?
- Are there any conflicts with your task?

#### 5. Search Existing Codebase

**CRITICAL: Always check if code already exists!**

```bash
# Search by feature name
glob_file_search('**/*federated_learning*.dart')

# Search by concept
grep('class.*FederatedLearning')
codebase_search('How does federated learning work in this codebase?')

# Check specific directories
list_dir('lib/presentation/widgets/settings/')
```

**What you might find:**
- ✅ Complete implementation (just needs integration)
- ⚠️ Partial implementation (needs completion)
- ✅ Similar pattern (can be copied/adapted)
- ❌ Nothing (build from scratch)

**Example Discovery:**
```bash
$ glob_file_search('**/*federated*.dart')

Found 4 files:
- federated_learning_settings_section.dart (430 lines)
- federated_learning_status_widget.dart (500 lines)
- privacy_metrics_widget.dart
- federated_participation_history_widget.dart

→ All 4 widgets already exist!
→ Task changes from "implement" to "integrate"
→ Timeline drops from 11 days to 4 hours
```

#### 6. Check Backend/Data Models

**Understand the data layer before building UI.**

```bash
# Find core models
glob_file_search('**/models/*.dart')
glob_file_search('**/core/**/*.dart')

# Read relevant models
read_file('lib/core/p2p/federated_learning.dart')
```

**What to extract:**
- What data models exist?
- What services are available?
- What APIs can you call?
- What's the data structure?

**Example:**
```dart
// Found in federated_learning.dart
class FederatedLearningRound {
  final String roundId;
  final RoundStatus status;
  final LearningObjective objective;
  // ... more fields
}

enum RoundStatus { initializing, training, aggregating, completed, failed }

→ Now I know what data I'm working with!
→ Can design UI around these models
```

#### 7. Identify Integration Points

**Where does this feature connect to the rest of the system?**

```bash
# Check routing
read_file('lib/presentation/routes/app_router.dart')

# Check main pages
glob_file_search('**/pages/**/*.dart')

# Check existing integrations
grep('Navigator.push')
grep('context.go')
```

**Map out:**
- Entry points (where users access this)
- Data flow (where data comes from/goes to)
- Dependencies (what services does it need)
- Impacts (what other features are affected)

**Integration Checklist:**
- [ ] Where do users navigate to this?
- [ ] What page/widget contains it?
- [ ] What services does it depend on?
- [ ] What other features does it affect?
- [ ] Are there any breaking changes?

---

### Optimal Placement Strategy

**Where should new code go? Follow this decision tree:**

#### UI Components (Widgets)

```
Is it shared across the app?
├─ YES → lib/presentation/widgets/common/
└─ NO → Is it feature-specific?
    ├─ YES → lib/presentation/widgets/[feature_name]/
    └─ NO → lib/presentation/widgets/settings/ (if settings-related)

Examples:
- Shared: lib/presentation/widgets/common/ai_thinking_indicator.dart
- Feature: lib/presentation/widgets/settings/federated_learning_settings.dart
```

#### Pages (Full Screens)

```
What's the feature area?
├─ Settings → lib/presentation/pages/settings/
├─ Profile → lib/presentation/pages/profile/
├─ Network → lib/presentation/pages/network/
├─ Admin → lib/presentation/pages/admin/
└─ Other → lib/presentation/pages/[feature_name]/

Examples:
- lib/presentation/pages/settings/federated_learning_page.dart
- lib/presentation/pages/network/device_discovery_page.dart
```

#### Services (Business Logic)

```
What layer?
├─ Core service → lib/core/services/
├─ Feature service → lib/core/[feature_name]/
└─ Data service → lib/data/services/

Examples:
- lib/core/services/llm_service.dart (core)
- lib/core/services/action_history_service.dart (core)
- lib/core/p2p/federated_learning.dart (feature)
```

#### Models (Data Structures)

```
What scope?
├─ Core domain → lib/core/models/
├─ Feature-specific → lib/core/[feature_name]/models/
└─ API models → lib/data/models/

Examples:
- lib/core/models/user.dart (core domain)
- lib/core/ai/action_models.dart (feature)
```

#### Tests

```
Mirror the source structure:
lib/presentation/widgets/settings/feature.dart
→ test/widget/widgets/settings/feature_test.dart

lib/core/services/service.dart
→ test/unit/services/service_test.dart
```

**Placement Decision Matrix:**

| Type | Scope | Location |
|------|-------|----------|
| Widget | Shared | `lib/presentation/widgets/common/` |
| Widget | Feature | `lib/presentation/widgets/[feature]/` |

---

## Pre-Implementation Phase

### Step 1: Understand the Plan

**Before writing any code, thoroughly understand:**

1. **What needs to be built?**
   - Read the entire plan document
   - Identify all deliverables
   - Note dependencies between components
   - Understand the user journey

2. **What already exists?**
   - Search for existing implementations
   - Check for related code
   - Identify reusable components
   - Review past completion documents

3. **What's the context?**
   - Read backend data models
   - Understand existing architecture
   - Review design tokens/themes
   - Check testing patterns

**Example:**
```bash
# Phase 2.1: Federated Learning UI

# Step 1: Read the plan
- 4 widgets needed: Settings, Status, Metrics, History
- Location: Settings/Account page
- Timeline: 11 days

# Step 2: Check what exists
$ glob_file_search "**/federated*.dart"
# Found: 4 widgets already implemented!

# Step 3: Understand context
$ read_file lib/core/p2p/federated_learning.dart
# Backend models: FederatedLearningRound, PrivacyMetrics, etc.
```

### Step 2: Create a TODO List

**Transform the plan into actionable tasks:**

```dart
todo_write(
  merge: false,
  todos: [
    {"id": "1", "status": "pending", "content": "Component A"},
    {"id": "2", "status": "pending", "content": "Component B"},
    {"id": "3", "status": "pending", "content": "Integration"},
    {"id": "4", "status": "pending", "content": "Testing"},
    {"id": "5", "status": "pending", "content": "Documentation"},
  ]
)
```

**TODO List Best Practices:**
- ✅ **Specific**: "Create FederatedLearningPage" not "Do UI"
- ✅ **Ordered**: Logical sequence (dependencies first)
- ✅ **Granular**: Tasks that can be completed in one session
- ✅ **Trackable**: Clear completion criteria
- ❌ **Avoid**: "Fix bugs" (too vague), "Research" (no end state)

### Step 3: Assess the Situation

**Before starting, answer:**

1. **What's already done?**
   - Component X exists (reuse it)
   - Component Y is half-done (complete it)
   - Nothing exists (build from scratch)

2. **What's the critical path?**
   - Backend before frontend
   - Core components before optional features
   - Data models before UI

3. **What are the risks?**
   - Missing dependencies
   - Complex integrations
   - Unknown APIs

4. **What's the realistic timeline?**
   - Planned: 11 days
   - Already done: 8 days worth
   - Remaining: 3 days
   - Adjust expectations accordingly

---

## Execution Phase

### Phase 1: Build Components

**Work through TODO list systematically:**

```
TODO 1: [in_progress] Create Component A
    ↓
1. Read relevant backend code
2. Understand data models
3. Check existing patterns
4. Implement component
5. Test locally (read_lints)
6. Mark complete
    ↓
TODO 2: [in_progress] Create Component B
    ↓
(repeat)
```

**Key Actions:**

1. **Read Before Writing**
   ```dart
   // Always read existing code first
   read_file('lib/core/models/data_model.dart')
   
   // Understand patterns
   grep('class.*Widget.*Settings')
   
   // Then implement following patterns
   ```

2. **Implement Incrementally**
   - Start with simplest version
   - Add features one at a time
   - Test after each addition
   - Don't add complexity prematurely

3. **Use Existing Patterns**
   - Follow codebase conventions
   - Reuse color tokens (AppColors)
   - Match existing widget structures
   - Maintain consistency

4. **Check Quality Continuously**
   ```bash
   # After each component
   read_lints(['path/to/new/file.dart'])
   
   # Fix immediately
   # Don't accumulate errors
   ```

### Phase 2: Integration

**Components alone aren't features. Integrate them:**

1. **Wire Data Flow**
   ```dart
   // Component → Backend
   Widget → Service → Repository → Database
   
   // Verify each connection
   ```

2. **Add Navigation**
   ```dart
   // Add route
   GoRoute(path: 'feature', builder: (c, s) => FeaturePage())
   
   // Add link
   ListTile(
     title: Text('Feature'),
     onTap: () => context.go('/feature'),
   )
   ```

3. **Register Services**
   ```dart
   // In injection_container.dart
   sl.registerLazySingleton<NewService>(
     () => NewService(),
   );
   ```

4. **Test Integration**
   - Can user navigate to feature?
   - Does data flow correctly?
   - Do actions work end-to-end?

### 2.5 Replace Mock Data with Real Data

**When to Use:** When backend service becomes available  
**Reference:** See detailed protocol in `MOCK_DATA_REPLACEMENT_PROTOCOL.md`

#### Quick Checklist (2 min)

When you encounter mock data and the service is ready:

```
☑️ Step 1: Identify Mock Data
   - Search for "// Mock data" or "// TODO: Load"
   - Check for hardcoded fake data
   - Verify service availability

☑️ Step 2: Verify Service Exists
   - Check service in lib/core/services/
   - Verify registration in injection_container.dart
   - Ensure methods match requirements

☑️ Step 3: Replace Incrementally
   - Add service dependency via DI
   - Replace mock with service call
   - Handle loading/error states
   - Update UI with real data

☑️ Step 4: Test with Real Data
   - Test with actual backend
   - Validate data mapping
   - Handle edge cases

☑️ Step 5: Clean Up
   - Remove hardcoded mock data
   - Remove "// Mock data" comments
   - Remove unused variables
```

#### Full Protocol (10 min)

**See detailed protocol:** `docs/plans/methodology/MOCK_DATA_REPLACEMENT_PROTOCOL.md`

**Key Steps:**

1. **Identify Mock Data**
   ```bash
   # Search for mock data
   grep -r "// Mock data" lib/presentation/
   grep -r "// TODO: Load" lib/presentation/
   ```

2. **Verify Service Availability**
   ```dart
   // Check service exists and is registered
   glob_file_search('**/*service_name*.dart')
   grep('ServiceName', path: 'lib/injection_container.dart')
   ```

3. **Replace Incrementally**
   ```dart
   // Before (mock):
   await Future.delayed(const Duration(seconds: 1));
   _brandAccount = BrandAccount(id: 'brand-mock-1', ...);
   
   // After (real):
   final service = context.read<BrandAccountService>();
   final brand = await service.getBrandAccountByUserId(userId);
   setState(() => _brandAccount = brand);
   ```

4. **Test with Real Data**
   - Test with actual backend
   - Validate data mapping
   - Handle edge cases (null, errors, empty)

5. **Clean Up**
   - Remove all mock code
   - Update comments
   - Remove unused variables

#### Common Scenarios

**Scenario 1: UI Mock Data**
- **Location:** `lib/presentation/pages/`
- **Example:** `brand_dashboard_page.dart` (lines 40-121)
- **Pattern:** Replace hardcoded data with service calls

**Scenario 2: Service Integration**
- **Location:** Service layer
- **Pattern:** Use repository pattern (already handles offline/online)

**Scenario 3: Offline-First Pattern**
- **SPOTS Architecture:** Repository pattern handles local + remote
- **Key Point:** Connect UI to repository, not directly to service

**See full examples in:** `MOCK_DATA_REPLACEMENT_PROTOCOL.md`

### Phase 3: Polish & Complete

**Don't stop at "it compiles":**

1. **Fix All Linter Issues**
   ```bash
   flutter analyze path/to/code
   # Fix ALL warnings and errors
   # Not just errors - warnings too
   ```

2. **Add Tests**
   ```dart
   // Widget tests
   testWidgets('Feature renders', (tester) async {
     // Test rendering
   });
   
   // Integration tests
   test('Feature flow works', () async {
     // Test complete flow
   });
   ```

3. **Handle Edge Cases**
   - Empty states
   - Error states
   - Loading states
   - Offline behavior

4. **Optimize Performance**
   - Remove unnecessary rebuilds
   - Cache expensive operations
   - Lazy load when possible

---

## Quality Assurance

### Continuous Quality Checks

**After EVERY file change:**

```bash
# 1. Check syntax/compilation
read_lints(['path/to/file.dart'])

# 2. Fix immediately
# Don't move on with errors

# 3. Verify integration
# Does it still work with other parts?
```

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: Discovery of Existing Code

**When you find existing implementations:**

```
1. Assess what exists
   ├─► Read existing code
   ├─► Check quality/completeness
   └─► Determine what's missing

2. Adjust plan
   ├─► Update TODOs
   ├─► Communicate findings
   └─► Focus on gaps

3. Build on existing
   ├─► Don't rebuild
   ├─► Integrate what exists
   └─► Add missing pieces
```

### Pattern 2: Integration of Multiple Components

**When combining multiple pieces:**

```
1. Create integration layer
   └─► New page/component that combines others

2. Add navigation
   ├─► Route in app_router.dart
   └─► Link in appropriate location

3. Test flow
   ├─► Can user navigate?
   └─► Do components work together?

4. Document integration
   └─► Show complete user journey
```

### Pattern 3: Enhancing Existing Features

**When improving what's there:**

```
1. Understand current implementation
   ├─► Read existing code thoroughly
   └─► Identify limitations

2. Plan enhancements
   ├─► What's missing?
   └─► What can be improved?

3. Implement additions
   ├─► Add new functionality
   ├─► Maintain backward compatibility
   └─► Test existing + new together

4. Update documentation
   └─► Note changes and improvements
```

### Pattern 4: Backend-First Features

**When backend must precede frontend:**

```
1. Backend
   ├─► Data models
   ├─► Services
   ├─► Repositories
   └─► Tests

2. Frontend
   ├─► Widgets (use mock data)
   ├─► UI/UX
   └─► Tests

3. Integration
   ├─► Wire backend to frontend
   ├─► Replace mocks with real data (see Section 2.5)
   └─► End-to-end tests

4. Polish
   └─► Error handling, loading states
```

---

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### ❌ Anti-Pattern 1: Code Without Integration

**Problem:**
```dart
// Created beautiful widget
class AwesomeWidget extends StatelessWidget { ... }

// But... how do users access it?
// No route, no link, isolated component
```

**Solution:**
- Always add navigation
- Always add access point
- Always test user can reach it

### ❌ Anti-Pattern 2: Ignoring Linter Warnings

**Problem:**
```bash
flutter analyze
# 27 warnings
# "I'll fix them later"
# (never fixes them)
```

**Solution:**
- Fix warnings immediately
- Treat warnings as errors
- Don't accumulate technical debt

### ❌ Anti-Pattern 3: Documentation After the Fact

**Problem:**
```
Month 1: Implement features
Month 2: Implement more features
Month 3: "What did I build again?"
Month 4: Try to write documentation (incomplete, inaccurate)
```

**Solution:**
- Document as you go
- Complete documentation per phase
- Don't delay documentation

### ❌ Anti-Pattern 4: Building Without Understanding

**Problem:**
```dart
// Sees plan: "Create FederatedLearningWidget"
// Immediately starts coding
// Builds duplicate of existing code
// Wastes time
```

**Solution:**
- Read existing code FIRST
- Search for related implementations
- Build on what exists

### ❌ Anti-Pattern 5: Partial Completion

**Problem:**
```
TODO: Create Feature X
├─► Component created ✓
├─► Test written ✓
├─► Docs written ✓
└─► Integration... skipped ✗

Result: Feature exists but users can't access it
```

**Solution:**
- Complete ALL steps
- Don't skip integration
- Finish what you start

### ❌ Anti-Pattern 6: Assuming vs. Verifying

**Problem:**
```
"I assume the backend has method X"
(codes against assumed API)
(doesn't exist, everything breaks)
```

**Solution:**
- Read backend code
- Verify APIs exist
- Test integration early

## Tools & Techniques

### Essential Tools

1. **File Operations**
   ```dart
   read_file('path')      // Read before modifying
   write('path', content) // Create new files
   search_replace()       // Modify existing files
   ```

2. **Search & Discovery**
   ```dart
   grep('pattern', path: 'dir')        // Find code
   glob_file_search('**/*.dart')       // Find files
   codebase_search('How does X work?') // Semantic search
   ```

3. **Quality Checks**
   ```dart
   read_lints(['path'])         // Check errors
   run_terminal_cmd('flutter analyze') // Full analysis
   ```

4. **Organization**
   ```dart
   todo_write(merge: false, todos: [...]) // Create list
   todo_write(merge: true, todos: [...])  // Update list
   ```

### Workflow Techniques

**Technique 1: Read-Modify-Verify**
```
1. read_file()     // Understand current state
2. search_replace() // Make changes
3. read_lints()    // Verify correctness
```

**Technique 2: Breadth-First Implementation**
```
1. Create skeleton of all components
2. Implement core functionality in each
3. Add details and polish
4. Integrate everything
```

**Technique 3: Depth-First Implementation**
```
1. Pick one component
2. Build it completely (code + test + docs)
3. Integrate it
4. Move to next component
```

**Technique 4: Discovery-Driven Development**
```
1. Search for existing implementations
2. Assess what exists vs. what's needed
3. Fill gaps, don't rebuild
4. Document discoveries
```

### Code Organization

**File Structure Patterns:**
```

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Phase 1 Integration (from SPOTS)

**Task:** Integrate Phase 1.3 UI components

**Approach:**
```
1. Discovery Phase
   ├─► Read_file(ai_command_processor.dart)
   ├─► Found: Thinking indicator, streaming widgets exist
   └─► Gap: Not integrated into app flow

2. Planning Phase
   ├─► TODO 1: Add offline banner to home
   ├─► TODO 2: Add routes for discovery pages
   ├─► TODO 3: Add settings links
   ├─► TODO 4: Integrate thinking indicator
   ├─► TODO 5: Create enhanced chat interface
   └─► TODO 6: Tests + documentation

3. Execution Phase
   └─► Work through TODOs systematically
       ├─► Modify home_page.dart (add banner)
       ├─► Modify app_router.dart (add routes)
       ├─► Modify profile_page.dart (add links)
       ├─► Create enhanced_ai_chat_interface.dart
       ├─► Create integration tests
       └─► Write PHASE_1_INTEGRATION_COMPLETE.md

4. Verification Phase
   ├─► read_lints() on all modified files
   ├─► Verify navigation works
   └─► Check all TODOs complete

Result: ✅ All components integrated, users can access features
Time: ~4 hours vs 5 days estimated
```

### Example 2: Optional Enhancements (from SPOTS)

**Task:** Implement 3 optional enhancements

**Approach:**
```
1. Understanding Phase
   ├─► Read plan: SSE streaming, Action history, Enhanced offline
   ├─► Estimated: 3.5-5.5 days
   └─► Prioritize by impact

2. Implementation Strategy
   ├─► Start with highest impact (SSE streaming)
   ├─► Build incrementally
   └─► Test each before moving on

3. SSE Streaming
   ├─► Create Edge Function (supabase/functions/llm-chat-stream/)
   ├─► Enhance Dart client (LLMService.chatStream())
   ├─► Add toggle: useRealSSE=true/false
   └─► Test: Verify streaming works

4. Action History
   ├─► Create service (ActionHistoryService)
   ├─► Add persistence (GetStorage)
   ├─► Wire to UI (EnhancedAIChatInterface)
   └─► Note: Backend placeholders (for later)

5. Enhanced Offline
   ├─► Create service (EnhancedConnectivityService)
   ├─► Add HTTP ping verification
   ├─► Cache results for performance
   └─► Test: Verify accuracy

6. Documentation
   └─► OPTIONAL_ENHANCEMENTS_COMPLETE.md (comprehensive report)

Result: ✅ All 3 enhancements complete in single session
Benefits: 10x faster response time, undo capability, accurate offline detection
```

### Example 3: Phase 2.1 (from SPOTS)

**Task:** Complete Federated Learning UI

**Approach:**
```
1. Discovery Phase
   ├─► Read plan: 4 widgets, 11 days
   ├─► glob_file_search('**/federated*.dart')

## Key Takeaways

### The 10 Commandments of Implementation

1. **Understand before building** - Read existing code first
2. **Plan before coding** - Create TODO lists
3. **Build incrementally** - Small steps, frequent tests
4. **Integrate continuously** - Don't defer integration
5. **Fix immediately** - Don't accumulate errors
6. **Test thoroughly** - Edge cases matter
7. **Document as you go** - Don't delay documentation
8. **Communicate clearly** - Status updates are crucial
9. **Complete fully** - Finish what you start
10. **Verify constantly** - Use linters, tests, reviews

### Success Formula

```
Success = 
  (Clear Understanding × Systematic Execution × Quality Focus) 
  + Integration 
  + Documentation 
  - Technical Debt
```

### When You're Stuck

1. **Read more code** - Understanding beats guessing
2. **Search codebase** - Solution might exist
3. **Break it down** - Smaller tasks are easier
4. **Test incrementally** - Find where it breaks
5. **Ask for help** - When truly blocked

## Conclusion

**Great development is systematic, thorough, and complete.**

It's not about speed—it's about delivering features that:
- ✅ Work correctly
- ✅ Are integrated properly
- ✅ Are tested thoroughly
- ✅ Are documented completely
- ✅ Can be maintained easily

Follow this methodology, and you'll consistently deliver high-quality features on time, with minimal technical debt and maximum user value.
