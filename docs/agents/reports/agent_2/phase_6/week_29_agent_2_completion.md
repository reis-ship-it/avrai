# Agent 2: Week 29 Completion Report - Clubs/Communities UI

**Date:** November 25, 2025, 1:25 AM CST  
**Phase:** Phase 6 - Local Expert System Redesign  
**Week:** Week 29 - Clubs/Communities (Phase 3, Week 2)  
**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE**

---

## 📋 **Executive Summary**

Successfully implemented UI components for the Clubs/Communities system. Created `CommunityPage`, `ClubPage`, and `ExpertiseCoverageWidget` to display community and club information, organizational structure, and geographic coverage. Integrated with `CommunityService` and `ClubService` to enable users to join/leave communities and clubs, view members, events, and metrics. Updated `EventsBrowsePage` with Clubs/Communities tab integration.

**What Doors Does This Open?**
- **Community Doors:** Events naturally create communities (people who attend together)
- **Organization Doors:** Communities can organize as clubs (structure, leadership, hierarchy)
- **Expansion Doors:** Clubs can expand geographically (75% coverage rule - Week 30)
- **Leadership Doors:** Club leaders gain expertise recognition
- **Connection Doors:** People find their communities through events

**When Are Users Ready?**
- After successful events create communities automatically
- When communities need organizational structure (upgrade to clubs)
- When viewing club/community information and membership
- When browsing events from their clubs/communities

**Is This Being a Good Key?**
- ✅ Shows doors (communities, clubs) that users can open
- ✅ Displays organizational structure transparently
- ✅ Makes membership and roles clear
- ✅ Shows geographic coverage and expansion opportunities

**Is the AI Learning with the User?**
- ✅ AI tracks community growth and engagement
- ✅ AI monitors club organizational maturity
- ✅ AI calculates coverage percentages for geographic expansion
- ✅ AI learns from community/club activity patterns

## 🧩 **Addendum (2026-01-01): Community Discovery + True Compatibility**

**What shipped:**
- ✅ Added `CommunitiesDiscoverPage` (`/communities/discover`) to surface ranked community suggestions
- ✅ Added a “Discover” CTA in `EventsBrowsePage` when the user is on the Clubs/Communities scope

- ✅ Added a privacy-safe community 12D centroid to `Community` (`vibeCentroidDimensions` + contributor count)
- ✅ Community quantum term now prefers the stored centroid (so scores aren’t neutral when member profiles can’t be fetched)
- ✅ Added short-TTL caching for true compatibility ranking

- `lib/presentation/pages/communities/communities_discover_page.dart`
- `lib/presentation/routes/app_router.dart` (route: `/communities/discover`)
