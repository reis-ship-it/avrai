# Master Plan - LEGACY (Defunct)

> **STATUS: DEFUNCT -- FOR HISTORICAL REFERENCE ONLY**
>
> This document was the active execution plan from January 1, 2026 through February 8, 2026.
> It has been superseded by the new intelligence-first Master Plan.
>
> **New Master Plan:** [`docs/MASTER_PLAN.md`](./MASTER_PLAN.md)

> This file is preserved for historical context. Do NOT use it for planning or execution.
> All phase references (Phase 1-31) in this document refer to the legacy numbering system.

**Created:** January 1, 2026  
**Defunct Date:** February 8, 2026  
**Status:** ❌ DEFUNCT -- Superseded by Intelligence-First Master Plan  
**Reason:** Architectural paradigm shift to world-model-first architecture per ML System Deep Analysis and Improvement Roadmap  
**Reference:** `docs/agents/reports/ML_SYSTEM_DEEP_ANALYSIS_AND_IMPROVEMENT_ROADMAP.md`  
**Original appendix:** `docs/MASTER_PLAN_APPENDIX.md`

---

## 📐 **Notation System**

All work is organized using **Phase.Section.Subsection** notation:

- **Phase X**: major milestone (e.g., Phase 8: Onboarding Pipeline Fix)
- **Section Y**: work unit within phase (e.g., Section 8.3)
- **Subsection Z**: specific task within section (e.g., 8.3.2)

Shorthand:
- `X.Y.Z` (e.g., `8.3.2`)
- `X.Y` (e.g., `8.3`)
- `X` (e.g., `8`)

---

## 🚪 **Philosophy + Methodology (Non‑Negotiable)**

- **Doors, not badges**: every phase must answer: What doors? When ready? Good key? Learning?
- **40-minute context protocol**: read plans + search existing implementations before building.
- **Architecture**: ai2ai only (never p2p), offline-first, self-improving.
- **Packaging**: build packagable code with clear APIs (see integration guide).

**Required references:**
- `docs/plans/philosophy_implementation/DOORS.md`
- `OUR_GUTS.md`
- `docs/plans/philosophy_implementation/SPOTS_PHILOSOPHY_AND_ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `docs/plans/methodology/DEVELOPMENT_METHODOLOGY.md`
- `docs/plans/methodology/MASTER_PLAN_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md`

## 🧭 **How to Use This File**

This file answers **“what’s next and where do I go?”** (ordering + pointers).

For “what’s done / in progress / blocked”, use **only**:
- `docs/agents/status/status_tracker.md`

For full phase/section writeups, formulas, and long specs:
- `docs/MASTER_PLAN_APPENDIX.md`

---

## 🔄 **Parallel Execution (Tier-Aware)**

Use tiers to run phases in parallel when dependencies allow.

- **Tier 0**: blocks many others → must complete first
- **Tier 1**: independent → can run in parallel
- **Tier 2**: dependent → can run in parallel once deps satisfied
- **Tier 3**: advanced → last tier

**Coordination rules (high-level):**
- Use service locking/versioning before breaking changes.
- Run integration checkpoints between tiers.

## 💰 **Outside Industry Sales & Data Monetization**

**Overview:** AVRAI's privacy-preserving aggregate data capabilities enable revenue streams through selling insights to outside industries while maintaining strict privacy guarantees.

**Foundation:** Phase 22 (Outside Data-Buyer Insights) provides the privacy-preserving data export infrastructure required for all outside industry sales.

### **Industry Integrations:**

| Phase | Industry | Market Size | Revenue Potential | Key Use Cases |
|------:|----------|------------|-------------------|---------------|
| 28 | Government | $510M-$1.3B contracts | $2M-$20M/year | Policy insights, voter segmentation, emergency response |
| 29 | Finance | $11.65B-$135.72B (alt data) | $15M-$50M/year | Credit risk, investment strategy, fraud detection, trading |
| 30 | PR Agencies | $68.7B-$141.56B (PR) + $33B (influencer) | $10M-$30M/year | Media monitoring, influencer discovery, campaign measurement |
| 31 | Hospitality | $4.7T (hospitality) + $7.6B (tech) | $8M-$25M/year | Guest personalization, revenue optimization, location intelligence, staff scheduling |

**Total Combined Revenue Potential (Year 1-5):** $35M-$125M/year

### **Common Architecture:**
- **Privacy Framework:** All integrations use Phase 22 privacy-preserving data export
- **Pricing Tiers:** Starter → Professional → Enterprise → Global Enterprise
- **Data Products:** Industry-specific data products built on aggregate personality/behavior data
- **Compliance:** Industry-specific regulatory compliance (SOX, GDPR, financial regulations, etc.)

### **Dependencies:**
- ✅ **Phase 22 (Outside Data-Buyer Insights)** - Required foundation for all outside industry sales
- ✅ **PaymentService** - For subscription management
- ✅ **Compliance Infrastructure** - Industry-specific compliance requirements
